# ItemEffects

ItemEffects allows you to expand possibilities of the [Libreforge effects system](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect) beyond the limits of
certain items, giving you the ability to add new abilities/modifiers to any item with just a simple command,
or by creating custom obtainable items that will empower your items with a simple drag and drop.

## What are the features ?

The plugin is very feature-rich and configurable, but there are some main things that it can do:

* Ability to create unlimited pre-configured [Effects](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect) configs to apply them to items
* Define which slots the effects will work in (hand/offhand/armor/any/etc)
* Use [Conditions](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-a-condition) to limit usage of new item features
to certain players/circumstances
* Create unlimited [Scrolls](Configuring-A-Scroll.md) with configurable recipes that can be applied to certain
items via drag and drop
* Some new custom [Libreforge effects](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect) to use within this and
other plugins supporting this system
* Some new custom [Libreforge conditions](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-a-condition) to use within this and
other plugins supporting this system
* A new lookup arg parser for [The lookup system](https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/the-item-lookup-system)
allowing you to apply scrolls in your plugin configs (e.g. `item: netherite_sword scroll:reinforcement_swords`)
* *Missing anything ? Request a feature in my discord DMs! (`@dkoften`)*
