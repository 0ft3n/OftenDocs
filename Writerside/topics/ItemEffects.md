# ItemEffects

ItemEffects allows you to expand possibilities of the [Libreforge effects system](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect) beyond the limits of
certain items, giving you the ability to add new abilities/modifiers to any item with just a simple command

## What are the features ?

The plugin is very feature-rich and configurable, but there are some main things that it can do:

* Ability to create unlimited pre-configured [Effects](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect) configs to apply them to items
* Define which slots the effects will work in (hand/offhand/armor/any/etc)
* Use [Conditions](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-a-condition) to limit usage of new item features
to certain players/circumstances
* *Missing anything ? Request a feature in my discord DMs! (`@dkoften`)*
