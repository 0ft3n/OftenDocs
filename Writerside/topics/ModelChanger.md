# ModelChanger

ModelChanger is a simple yet cool and powerful plugin allowing you to utilize bukkit custom model id with your server
resourcepack to introduce per-item changeable skins for player items

## What are the features ?

The plugin is very feature-rich and configurable, but there are some main things that it can do:

* A configurable GUI allowing player to switch available skins for an item in their hand.
* [Item lookup](https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/the-item-lookup-system) system support
* Restrict skins by permissions to make them a donor perk/quest reward/you name it
* *Missing anything ? Request a feature in my discord DMs! (`dkoften`)*
